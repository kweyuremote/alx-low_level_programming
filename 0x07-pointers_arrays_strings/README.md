# Project Name

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external resources:

### General

1. Pointers to Pointers and how to use them: Pointers to Pointers, also known as double pointers, are pointers that store the address of another pointer. They are used to allocate and access memory in a more flexible manner. By understanding pointers to pointers, you can create dynamic arrays, manipulate function arguments, and implement complex data structures efficiently.

2. Multidimensional Arrays and how to use them: Multidimensional arrays are arrays that have more than one dimension. They are used to store and access data in a tabular form, such as matrices. Understanding multidimensional arrays allows you to work with data in a structured manner and implement algorithms that require multiple dimensions.

3. Common C Standard Library Functions to manipulate strings: The C standard library provides several functions to perform various operations on strings. By learning these functions, you can efficiently manipulate and process strings in C. Some of the common string manipulation functions include strcpy, strcat, strlen, strcmp, and more.

## Copyright - Plagiarism

Any form of plagiarism will result in immediate removal from the program.

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the following options: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All your files should end with a new line.
- You must include a README.md file at the root of the project folder.
- Your code should follow the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
- Usage of global variables is not allowed.
- Each file should contain no more than 5 functions.
- You are not allowed to use standard library functions like printf, puts, etc.
- You are allowed to use the `_putchar` function.
- You don’t have to push `_putchar.c`, as we will use our own file. If you do, it won’t be taken into account.
- Although the examples show main.c files, you can use them to test your functions, but you don't have to push them to your repository. We will use our own main.c files at compilation, which might be different from the ones shown in the examples.
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the `_putchar` function should be included in your header file called `main.h`.
- Don’t forget to push your header file.

## Project Structure

The project should have the following structure:
