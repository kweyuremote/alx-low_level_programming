# Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you will be able to explain the following topics without the help of Google:

## General

1. Pointers and How to Use Them:
   - Understand the concept of pointers as variables that store memory addresses.
   - Explain how to declare pointer variables and assign memory addresses to them.
   - Describe the process of dereferencing pointers to access the values they point to.
   - Demonstrate the significance of pointers in dynamic memory allocation.

2. Arrays and How to Use Them:
   - Define arrays as collections of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations.
   - Illustrate how to declare and initialize arrays with different data types and sizes.
   - Explain array indexing and how to access individual elements of an array.
   - Explore one-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays and their applications.

3. Differences Between Pointers and Arrays:
   - Differentiate between pointers and arrays in C/C++.
   - Understand how arrays decay into pointers when passed to functions.
   - Explain the implications of pointer arithmetic and array indexing.

4. How to Use Strings and Manipulate Them:
   - Define strings as arrays of characters terminated by a null character (`'\0'`).
   - Demonstrate how to declare and initialize strings in C/C++.
   - Illustrate common string manipulation techniques using standard library functions.
   - Show how to concatenate, compare, and extract substrings from strings.

5. Scope of Variables:
   - Explain variable scope in C/C++ programming.
   - Differentiate between global and local variables.
   - Describe the visibility and lifetime of variables in different scopes.
   - Demonstrate the use of static variables in functions.

# Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you will be able to explain the following topics without the help of Google:

## General

1. **Pointers and How to Use Them:**
   - Pointers are variables that store memory addresses. They allow indirect manipulation of data by pointing to the memory location where the data is stored.
   - To use pointers, you need to declare a pointer variable and assign the memory address of a variable to it using the address-of operator `&`.
   - Dereferencing a pointer means accessing the value it points to using the dereference operator `*`.

2. **Arrays and How to Use Them:**
   - Arrays are collections of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations.
   - To use arrays, you need to declare the array and specify its size, and you can initialize the elements during declaration or later in the program.
   - Array elements are accessed using an index, starting from 0 to size-1.

3. **Differences Between Pointers and Arrays:**
   - Pointers and arrays are closely related in C/C++. When an array is declared, it can decay into a pointer to its first element.
   - Pointer arithmetic and array indexing are different concepts. Pointer arithmetic allows moving through memory locations based on the data type, whereas array indexing accesses elements directly.

4. **How to Use Strings and Manipulate Them:**
   - Strings in C/C++ are represented as arrays of characters terminated by a null character `'\0'`.
   - To use strings, you can declare character arrays and initialize them with string literals or assign them character by character.
   - String manipulation involves various operations like concatenation, comparison, and extracting substrings. You can use standard library functions like `strcpy`, `strcat`, `strcmp`, etc.

5. **Scope of Variables:**
   - Variable scope defines the portion of the program where a variable can be accessed.
   - Global variables are declared outside of functions and can be accessed throughout the program. Local variables are declared inside functions and have limited visibility within that function.
   - Variables have different lifetimes depending on their scope. Global variables exist throughout the program's execution, while local variables are created when the function is called and destroyed when it exits.
